# RacingGL
RacingGL is a multiplayer split screen racing game where players compete one against the other to win the race. During the race players will collect objects to obtain power that will improve his speed, or decrease the speed, also an item that can damage you or increase your health. The first player to cross the line wins. For this we will apply the concepts learned during Computer Graphics and we will show a fully implemented project with multiplayer, sprites and a lot of fun. 

We have multiple features we want to archive on our project one of them are collisions a proper feeling when cars collide between them. Other feature we have is to generate a procedural race track, we decide this because we want a track from point A to point B because making a circuit would be really difficult in a procedural way. So, each time someone want to play they will get a different experience. But on this feature we want to be careful with the algorithm because if we give a lot of freedom the algorithm we may generate a track with dead ends or with no ending. And from the other perspective we want don't want to be to straight on the algorithm because we could end with an algorithm that ends up generating race tracks that have a 80% of similarities between them. And our final main feature will be shooting giving the players the ability to fight and make the competition interesting.
